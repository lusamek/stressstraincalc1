The code is a simple demonstration for education purposes, to show the strengthening mechanims based on glide.

It can be used for a fully bainitic steel or a ferritic steel.
To make a steel with two constituents, e.g. bainite and ferrite, just add the mixture law.



TO COMPILE:
   -On linux:
	  gcc -lm glide.c -o glide.bin; ./glide.bin  ; pdflatex graph.tex ; mupdf graph.pdf 
   -On Win32
	  It shall be similar.


LIBS AND REQUIREMENTS:
   {GCC, Math lib,
    PDFLATEX (optional)}

   - It has a relatively minimal lib requirement.
   - It needs GCC and math.h (math lib)
   - It can run on any platforms, since the plot of the flow curve is made by using PDFLATEX
